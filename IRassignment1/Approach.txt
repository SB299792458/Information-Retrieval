Take lines from DataSet.txt one by one.
Select each word, if not in stop words' list, then add to HashMap Data Structure.
Sort the hash map.
Output the sorted hash map as inverted index dictionary to InvertedIndex.txt
For each key value in dictionary create permutes and add to PermuteTermIndex.txt

We are now ready to execute wild card query.

Take the wild card query, add '$' and process it to bring * in the end.
For every line in PermuteTermIndex.txt, check if first word of the line ends with
the search query.
If yes, get the second word of the line, get its posting list and print the respective 
lines from DataSet.txt based on the list.

If nothing matches the document is blank.
